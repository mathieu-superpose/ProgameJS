## The app

Single application website, built with Webpack and awg.io API.
Published after 72h of coding as an exercise.

### Missing features

View more, filter, search, and internal links need to be implemented.

Mobile layout needs some ajustments (layout and CSS)

### Code improvement

CSS needs refactoring, and be separated into different files.
